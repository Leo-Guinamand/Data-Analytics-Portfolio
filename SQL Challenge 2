For this assignment, I created a table of songs available to sing at a karaoke club.
I then had to query songs that my friends wanted to sing. First, they wanted to know the 
songs that were either classified as an 'epic' mood, OR a song that cam out after 1990.
Later, they wanted to know the songs that were classified as an 'epic' mood, came out after 1990
AND had a duration of less than 4 minutes, or 240 seconds.

CREATE TABLE songs (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    title TEXT,
    artist TEXT,
    mood TEXT,
    duration INTEGER,
    released INTEGER);
    
INSERT INTO songs (title, artist, mood, duration, released)
    VALUES ("Bohemian Rhapsody", "Queen", "epic", 60, 1975);
INSERT INTO songs (title, artist, mood, duration, released)
    VALUES ("Let it go", "Idina Menzel", "epic", 227, 2013);
INSERT INTO songs (title, artist, mood, duration, released)
    VALUES ("I will survive", "Gloria Gaynor", "epic", 198, 1978);
INSERT INTO songs (title, artist, mood, duration, released)
    VALUES ("Twist and Shout", "The Beatles", "happy", 152, 1963);
INSERT INTO songs (title, artist, mood, duration, released)
    VALUES ("La Bamba", "Ritchie Valens", "happy", 166, 1958);
INSERT INTO songs (title, artist, mood, duration, released)
    VALUES ("I will always love you", "Whitney Houston", "epic", 273, 1992);
INSERT INTO songs (title, artist, mood, duration, released)
    VALUES ("Sweet Caroline", "Neil Diamond", "happy", 201, 1969);
INSERT INTO songs (title, artist, mood, duration, released)
    VALUES ("Call me maybe", "Carly Rae Jepsen", "happy", 193, 2011);

SELECT title FROM songs;

SELECT title FROM songs 
WHERE mood = 'epic'
OR released > '1990';

SELECT title FROM songs 
WHERE mood = 'epic'
AND released > '1990'
AND duration < 240;
